 Turns an `ServiceEndpoint` into an `NSURLRequest` by assigning the endpoint a locator
 path or substituting variables to get the HTTP endpoint, then builds the request by
 filling in the body using a `ServiceRequestConfigurator` and using a set of
 `ServiceRequestDecorator` behaviors to prepare the request.

 A typical pattern for generating a request would be:
 
 1. Generate an `ServiceRequestPayload` containing information pertinent to the request.
 2. Init an `ServiceRequestConfigurator` of the appropriate type using the payload.
 3. Fetch a `ServiceRequest` using the `Service` responsible for handling the request.
 4. Generate an `NSURLRequest` from the request and active session via `URLRequest(session:)`.
